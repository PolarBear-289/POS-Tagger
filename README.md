# POS-Tagger
This repo contains tutorials covering how to perform part-of-speech (PoS) tagging using PyTorch 1.8, torchtext 0.9, and and spaCy 3.0, using Python 3.8.

This covers the workflow of a PoS tagging project with PyTorch and TorchText. I have used the basic TorchText concepts such as: defining how data is processed; using TorchText's datasets and how to use pre-trained embeddings. Using PyTorch we built a strong baseline model: a multi-layer bi-directional LSTM. We also show how the model can be used for inference to tag any input text.
